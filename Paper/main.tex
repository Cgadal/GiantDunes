\section{Introduction}
\section{Wind regimes across the Namib Sand Sea}

  \begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[scale=1]{Figures/Figure1.pdf}
    \caption{Wind data used in this study \textbf{a}: Location of the studied sites. \textbf{b--e}: Satellite images of the studied sites (Google-Earth, Maxar Technologies, CNES/Airbus). In each subplot, the left and right wind roses represent the data from the ERA5Land climate reanalysis and the in situ stations, respectively. Note that the bars show the direction towards which the wind blows. The red dots show the location of the in situ stations.}
    \label{Fig1}
  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Datasets}

  Two wind datasets are used in this study. First, local winds are provided by stations situated in different environments (see Fig.~\ref{Fig1}). The wind strength and direction are measured every 10 minutes by cup anemometers and wind vanes, at heights between $n$ and $n$ meters depending on the station. The available period of measurements ranges from 1 to 5 discontinuous years distributed between 2012 and 2020 (see Fig.~\ref{Fig1_supp}). We checked that at least one complete seasonal cycle is available at each station.
  %
  Then, regional winds are extracted at the same locations and periods from the ERA5-Land dataset, which is a replay at a smaller spatial resolution of ERA5, the latest climate reanalysis from the ECMWWF \citep{Hersbach2020, munoz2021}. It provides hourly estimates of the 10-m wind velocity and direction at a spatial resolution of $\sim 9~\textup{km}$ ($0.1^\circ\times0.1^\circ$).

  For comparison, the local measurements are averaged into 1-hr bins centered on the temporal scale of the ERA5-Land estimates (see Fig.~\ref{Fig2_supp}). As the wind velocities of both datasets are provided a different heights, we convert them into shear velocities (see SI section~\ref{}), characteristic of the whole turbulent wind profile within the atmospheric boundary layer, which are then used together with the wind direction for further analysis. The resulting wind data are shown on the wind roses of Fig.~\ref{Fig1}(b--e).

  Finally, the dune properties are computed using an autocorrelation method from the 30-m Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the shuttle radar topography mission \citep{Farr2007}. For the South Namib and Deep Sea stations, we obtain respectively orientations of $85^\circ$ and $125^\circ$, wavelengths of $2.6~\textup{km}$ and $2.3~\textup{km}$ and amplitudes of $45~\textup{m}$ and $20~\textup{m}$ (see SI for additional details).

  \subsection{Agreement between local and regional winds}

  \begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1]{Figures/Figure2.pdf}
    \caption{Temporal comparison between the wind data coming from the Era5Land climate reanalysis (orange lines) and from the in situ measurements (blue lines). \textbf{a--b}: Huab station. \textbf{c--d}: Deep Sea station in winter. \textbf{e--f}: Deep Sea station in summer.}
    \label{Fig2}
  \end{figure}

  The regional wind patterns in the Namib are strongly controlled by the see breeze, resulting in strong northward components present in all regional wind roses of figure~\ref{Fig1}, also deviated by the large scale topography \citep{lancaster1985}. These daily winds are the strongest during the second-half of the year (Septembre-January). In winter, an additional easterly component can be recorded during the night, induced by the combination of katabatic winds forming on the mountains, and infrequent `berg' winds, which are responsible of the high wind velocities observed \citep{lancaster1984}. The frequency of these easterly components decreases from the inland to the coast, resulting in three bidirectional wind regimes within the Namib Sand Sea and at the Adamax salt pan (Fig.~\ref{Fig1}(c, d, e)) and one unidirectional wind regime on the coast at the outlet of the Huab River.

  In the case of the Adamax and Huab stations, these regional wind roses qualitatively matches their respective in situ local measurements. However, for the Deep Sea and South Namib stations, the local wind roses exhibit additional components aligned with the giant dune orientation visible on the satellite images.

  Indeed, the analysis of the wind speed and direction time series shows that the matching between the local and regional winds is verified for the stations with flat environment at all times (Fig.~\ref{Fig2}(a--b)), as well as for the stations within the giant dune field, but only during Septembre-January (Fig.~\ref{Fig2}(c--d). This agreement is statistically verified, as shown by the Fig.~\ref{Fig5_supp}.

  \subsection{Influence of the giant dunes on local wind regimes}

  In winter, the local and regional winds match only during the morning for the stations within the giant dune field, when the southerly/southwesterly sea breeze dominates (see Fig.~\ref{Fig2}(e--f), Fig.~\ref{Fig3} and Fig.~\ref{Fig6_supp}). In the late afternoon and during the night, when the northwesterly `berg' and katabatic winds blow, the two datasets differs. More specifically, this mismatch mainly occurs during at low wind velocities. In this case, the angular wind distribution of the local measurements exhibits two additional modes separated of $\simeq 180^\circ$, each corresponding to the giant dune alignement (purple frame in Fig.~\ref{Fig3} and Fig.~\ref{Fig6_supp}). This deviation at low wind velocities is statistically verified, and is also associated with a global attenuation of the wind strength (Fig.~\ref{Fig6_supp} and Fig.~\ref{Fig7_supp}).

    \includegraphics[scale=1]{Figures/Figure3.pdf}
    \caption{Distributions of wind direction at the Deep Sea Station for the Era5Land climate reanalysis (orange) and the in situ measurements (blue). In each subplot, both distributions are plotted from the same time steps, selected with constraints on the wind direction (columns) and/or wind velocity (rows) in the Era5Land dataset. The vertical gray dashed lines indicate the dune orientation, and the top right numbers the percentage of the total number of time steps selected in each subplot. The purple frame highlights the regime (small wind velocities, nocturnal summer wind) during which the wind data from both datasets differs. A similar figure can be obtained for the Deep Sea station (see Fig.~\ref{Fig6_supp}).}

  \section{Influence of the circadian cycle of the atmospheric boundary layer}

  Previous studies have linked meteorological flow around and over obstacles to the vertical structure of the atmosphere \citep{Stull1988}. At the dune scale, its lower part, the turbulent atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), is directly influenced by the planetary surface \citep{Stull1988}. When the latter is warmer than the ambient air (typically during the day), a strong convection takes place, resulting in a logarithmic wind profile and a vertically constant potential temperature $\theta$ (which corresponds to the air density corrected from the vertical pressure variation). During the night, the surface cools faster than the ambient air, which can result in a stable layer close to the surface (typically the first $200$ meters). Above, the free atmosphere (FA) is a stably stratified zone in which turbulence is negligible, and where the flow is usually considered as incompressible and inviscid. In the middle, a transitional layer, also known as entrainment zone, is characterized by a sharp increase of the potential temperature, which traps turbulence resulting fro the surface friction below it. As it is much shallow than the other two layers, we consider it as capping singularity inducing a discontinuity in the potential temperature profile.

  \subsection{Relevant non-dimensional parameters and physical modeling}
  \label{theoretical_framework}

  As a result, the giant dunes evolve in a turbulent flow capped by a stratified atmosphere, with a transitional layer acting as a free surface in between. When the dune are small enough, typically in the case of dune emergence or early coarsening (Fig.~\ref{Fig4}b), they do no interact with the top of the ABL \citep{Fourriere2010}. However, the giant dunes present in the Deep Sea and South Namib stations have wavelengths comparable or larger than typical ABL depths, inducing their interaction with the capping layer and the free atmosphere above \citep{andreotti2009}. However, as sketched in Fig.~\ref{Fig4}c--d, the nature of this interaction depends on two non-dimensional number, both called Froude numbers in the literature~\citep{Vosper2004, Sheridan2006, Hunt2006, Jiang2014}.

  The ability of the capping layer to deform under the presence of an underlying topography is controlled by the \emph{surface Froude number}, typically used in the context of bedforms in rivers \citep{Fourriere2010, Andreotti2012}:
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{S}} = \displaystyle\frac{U}{\sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho}gH}},
  \end{equation}
  where $U$ is the wind velocity at the top of the ABL, $H$ its depth, $\rho$ its average density and $\Delta\rho$ the density jump between the ABL and the FA.
  %
  Likewise, the FA stratification ability to deform is controlled by the \emph{internal Froude number}, typically used in the context of flow disturbances induced by mountains \citep{Stull1988}:
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{I}} = \displaystyle\frac{U}{H N},
  \end{equation}
  where $N$ is the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, characteristic of a stratified fluid.
  %
  When the flow inertia dominates over its weight ($\mathcal{F}r_{\textup{S}} \gg 1$) and the weight of the stratification ($\mathcal{F}r_{\textup{I}} \gg 1$), both the capping layer and the stratification deform and adapt to the underlying topography (Fig.~\ref{Fig4}d), resulting in an unconfined flow \citep{refs}. However, an opposite force balance induces a rigid capping layer and/or stratification (Fig.~\ref{Fig4}c), resulting in confined flows. In this case, the confined flow has trouble going smoothly over the obstacle, and are then typically associated with large deviations and modulation of the wind velocity, as qualitatively illustrated in the case of the Deep Sea station by Fig.~\ref{Fig4}e \citep{refs}.

  \subsection{Flow regime diagrams}

  In the spirit of \citet{Sheridan2006}, we aim to compute flow regime diagrams in the space defined by the three relevant non-dimensional numbers presented above, $\left(k H,\, \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{S}}, \, \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{I}}\right)$. They are calculated from the time series of the geopotential, temperature and specific humidity vertical profiles available in the ERA5 climate reanalysis (see SI~\ref{?}). The relative velocity modulation is computed as
  %
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_{\textup{u}} = \frac{u_{*}^{\textup{ERA}} -  u_{*}^{\textup{station}}}{u_{*}^{\textup{ERA}}},
  \end{equation}
  %
  and the flow deviation as the minimal angle between the wind orientation in the two datasets:
  %
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_{\theta} = \left\vert \textup{min}\left(\left[\theta_{\textup{ERA}} - \theta_{\textup{station}}\right] \, \textup{mod.} \, 360, \left[\theta_{\textup{station}} - \theta_{\textup{ERA}}\right] \, \textup{mod.} \, 360\right) \right\vert,
  \end{equation}
  %

  When these two variables are represented in the marginal spaces $(k H,\, \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{S}})$ and $(k H,\, \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{I}})$, different regime emerges (Fig.~\ref{Fig5}). The small wind disturbances ($\delta_{\theta} \to 0$, $\delta_{\textup{u}} \to 0$) are located in the top-right part of the diagrams, corresponding to a regime mixing low-interactions ($k H$ large enough, Fig.~\ref{Fig4}b) and low-confinement ($\mathcal{F}r_{\textup{S}}, \, \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{I}}$ large enough, Fig.~\ref{Fig4}c).

  Lower values of $k H$ (stronger interaction) or Froude numbers (stronger confinement) then both leads to an increase in wind disturbances, both in terms of orientation and velocity. Interestingly, the limit of no-interactions between the topography and the boundary layer structure ($k H \gg 1$), in which the properties of the capping layer and the stratification become irrelevant (Fig.~\ref{Fig4}b--\ref{Fig4}c), is never reached here, in the case of giant dunes.
  %
  Below a threshold value of $k H \simeq 0.3$, wind disturbance occurs independently of the Froude numbers value. However, the latter seem to control a transition between from damped to amplified wind velocities within the interdune (Fig.~\ref{Fig5}c--\ref{Fig5}d), for which we do not have an explanation.

\section{Discussion}

 The comparison of local and regional wind data gives a direct evidence of the giant dunes feedback on the flow. In flat areas, the matching between both datasets highlights the ability of the latest generation of climate reanalysis to predict the wind flow up to scales $\sim 10~\textrm{km}$, i.e the grid model. When smaller scale topographies are present (giant dunes in our case), locally measured wind regimes may significantly differ from the regional ones. Furthermore, we link these disturbances induced by the dunes to their interaction with the lower part of the atmospheric vertical structure, and more specifically to its circadian variability. During the day, the top of the ABL is high enough to limit the interaction of the capping layer and the FA stratification with the giant dunes, resulting in a low flow confinement, and thus small wind disturbances. During the night, the small ABL height induces a stronger flow confinement, associated with large wind deviation and acceleration or deceleration. Interestingly, we also found that this effect could be counterbalanced by the presence of large wind velocities, capable of deforming the capping layer and/or the FA stratification and thus decreasing the confinement effect.

 Simple linear model such as the one of \citet{andreotti2009} also suggests that larger wind disturbances occur under strong flow confinement such as described above. However, they are unable to reproduce the magnitude of the observed deviations, probably due to the presence of hydrodynamical non-linear effects, negligible in low confinement situations, but not otherwise (see Fig.~\ref{Fig12_supp} and Appendix 1). Another limit in the comparison between theoretical predictions and measured is induces by the the single-point measurements. To have reliable representations of the flow structures related to wind disturbances, additional measurements in different places on and near the same topographical obstacle are needed.

 This study highlights the interaction between giant dunes and the atmospheric boundary layer, thus supporting for example the way the capping layer acts as a bounding surface limiting dune growth \citep{andreotti2009, gunn2021}. This interaction also have implications at smaller scales, where bedforms then develop from the disturbed wind instead of the regional one. Differences between larger and smaller scale (thus older and more recent) dune patterns are observed ubiquitously, and have sometimes in the literature been attributed to climatic changes in wind regimes \citep{refs}. Here, we suggest using this feedback mechanism that current winds can explain dune patterns at all scales, such as the linear dunes ($\sim 50$ m -wide) elongating within the interdune between two giant linear dunes ($\sim 2$ km -wide) in the Namib Sand Sea (see Fig.~\ref{Fig6}).

\section*{Appendix 1: ABL turbulent wind model}

Following the work of \citet{Fourriere2010} and \citet{Andreotti2012}, we briefly expose in this section the linear response of a turbulent flow to a small aspect ratio perturbation of the topography $\xi$. As this topography can be decomposed into several sinusoidal modes, we focus on the response to a sinusoidal topography as:
\begin{equation}
  \xi = \xi_{0}\cos\left[k\left(\cos(\alpha)x + \sin(\alpha)y\right)\right],
\end{equation}
which is also a good approximation to the giant dunes observed in the Deep Sea and South Namib Station (see Fig~\ref{Fig1} and Fig~\ref{Fig4_supp}). Here, $x$ and $y$ are the streamwise and spanwise coordinates, $k=2\pi/\lambda$ the wavenumber of the sinusoidal perturbation, and $\alpha$ its crest orientation, calculated with respect to the $y$--direction.

In terms of basal shear stress $\tau = \rho u_{*}^{2}$, the flow response can then generally be written in as:
\begin{align}
  \tau_{x} & = \tau_{0}\left(1 + k\xi_{0}\sqrt{\mathcal{A}_{x}^{2} + \mathcal{B}_{x}^{2}}\cos\left[k\left(\cos(\alpha)x + \sin(\alpha)y\right) + \phi_{x}\right]\right), \\
  \tau_{y} & = \tau_{0}k\xi_{0}\sqrt{\mathcal{A}_{y}^{2} + \mathcal{B}_{y}^{2}}\cos\left[k\left(\cos(\alpha)x + \sin(\alpha)y\right) + \phi_{y}\right],
\end{align}
where $\tau_{0}$ is the basal shear stress on a flat bed, and $\phi_{x, y} = \tan^{-1}\left(\mathcal{B}_{x, y}/\mathcal{A}_{x, y}\right)$. The in--phase and in--quadrature hydrodynamical coefficients $\mathcal{A}_{x, y}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{x, y}$ are functions of the flow conditions, i.e the bottom roughness, the free surface or the incident flow direction \citep{Fourriere2010, andreotti2009, Andreotti2012, Charru2013}.

\citet{Andreotti2012} have shown that the impact of the incident wind direction can be well approximated by the following expressions:
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{A}_{x} & = \mathcal{A}_{0}\cos^{2}\alpha, \\
  \mathcal{B}_{x} & = \mathcal{B}_{0}\cos^{2}\alpha, \\
  \mathcal{A}_{y} & = \displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{A}_{0}\cos\alpha \sin\alpha, \\
  \mathcal{B}_{y} & = \displaystyle\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{B}_{0}\cos\alpha \sin\alpha,
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{A}_{0}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{0}$ are now two coefficients independent of the dune orientation $\alpha$. In the case of a fully turbulent boundary layer capped by a free atmosphere capping, they now only depend on $k H$, $k z_{0}$, $\mathcal{F}r_{\textup{I}}$ and $\mathcal{F}r_{\textup{S}}$, as detailed by \citet{andreotti2009}. More specifically, their variation in the marginal spaces $(k H,\, \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{S}})$ and $(k H,\, \mathcal{F}r_{\textup{I}})$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig12_supp}.

Typical values for the unconfined case are therefore $\mathcal{A}_{0} = 3.4$ and $\mathcal{B}_{0} = 1$. In our case of giant dunes with $k\xi_{0} \sim 0.1$, significant wind disturbances are then expected when $\sqrt{\mathcal{A}_{0}^{2} + \mathcal{B}_{0}^{2}} \sim 10$. However, this is also the limit of the linear regime where this theoretical model is applicable, as hydrodynamical non-linearities become significant when $k\xi_{0}\sqrt{\mathcal{A}_{0}^{2} + \mathcal{B}_{0}^{2}} \sim 1$.

\section*{Appendix 2: Sediment transport and dune morphodynamics}

Here, we briefly detail the sediment transport and dune morphodynamics theoretical framework leading to the prediction of sand fluxes and dune orientations from wind data.

The sediment fluxes can been directly linked to the wind basal shear stress at each time steps $t$ from transport laws, whose exact forms depends on the sediment transport mechanisms taken into account. In this work, we following the recent work of \citet{Pahtz2020}, where the sediment flux $q_{\textup{sat}}$ on a flat bed made of loose sand can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{transport_law}
  \frac{q_{\textup{sat, t}}}{Q} = \frac{2\sqrt{\Theta_{\textup{th}}}}{\kappa\mu}\left(\Theta_{t} - \Theta_{\textup{th}}\right)\left(1 +\frac{C_{\textup{M}}}{\mu}\left[\Theta_{t} - \Theta_{\textup{th}}\right]\right),
\end{equation}
where $\kappa = 0.4$ is the von Kármán constant, $C_{\rm M}=1.7$ a constant, $Q = d\sqrt{(\rho_{\textup{s}} - \rho)gd/\rho}$ is a characteristic flux, with $\rho_{\textup{s}} = 2.6~\textup{g}~\textup{cm}^{-3}$ and $d=180~\mu\textup{m}$ the grain density and diameter, and $g$ the gravitational acceleration. The friction coefficient $\mu$ is taken to be the avalanche slope of the granular material, i.e $\sim 0.6$. Finally, the Shields number is defined as $\Theta = \rho u_{*, t}^{2}/(\rho_{\textup{s}} - \rho)gd$, and its threshold value for incipient sediment transport as been calibrated using laboratory experiments to $\Theta_{\textup{th}} = 0.0035$.

The dune orientations are then predicted from the dimensional model of \citet{Courrech2014}. The orientation $\alpha$ corresponding the bed instability is then the one that maximizes the following growth rate:
\begin{equation}
  \sigma \propto \frac{1}{H W T}\int_{t}  q_{\textup{crest}, t}\vert \sin\left(\theta_{t} - \alpha\right) \vert,
\end{equation}
where $H$ and $W$ are dimensional constants representing the dune height and width, respectively. The flux at the crest is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
  q_{\textup{crest}, t} = q_{\textup{sat}, t}\left[1 + \gamma\vert\sin\left(\theta_{t} - \alpha\right)\vert\right],
\end{equation}
where the flux-up ratio $\gamma$ has been calibrated to 1.6 using field studies, underwater laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Similarly, the dune orientation corresponding to the elongation mechanism is the one that verifies:
\begin{equation}
  \tan(\alpha) = \frac{\langle q_{\textup{crest}, t}(\alpha) \boldsymbol{e}_{\theta_{t}}\rangle \cdot \boldsymbol{e}_{WE} }{ \langle q_{\textup{crest}, t}(\alpha) \boldsymbol{e}_{\theta_{t}} \rangle \cdot \boldsymbol{e}_{SN}},
\end{equation}
where $\langle.\rangle$ denotes a vectorial time average. The unitary vectors $\boldsymbol{e}_{WE}$, $\boldsymbol{e}_{SN}$ and $\boldsymbol{e}_{\theta_{t}}$ are in the West--East, South--North and wind direction, respectively.

The computed dune orientations, blue and red arrows in figure~\ref{Fig6}, are however depending on a large number of parameters, for which we took typical values for eolian desert on Earth. We therefore run a sensibility test by calculating the dune orientations for grain diameters ranging from $100~\mu\textup{m}$ to $400~\mu\textup{m}$ and the speed-up ratio from $0.1$ to $10$ (wedges on figure~\ref{Fig6}). We also checked the sensibility the transport low by repeating the process with the quadratic transport also used for comparison in \citet{Pahtz2020}, which led to no more than $n\%$ of variation with respect to \eqref{transport_law}.

\section*{1. Calibration of the hydrodynamical roughness}

For each station, the hydrodynamic roughness is calibrated by finding the one that minimizes the relative difference $\delta$ between the wind vectors of both datasets:

      \delta = \frac{\sqrt{\langle\| \boldsymbol{u}_{*, \textrm{era}} - \boldsymbol{u}_{*, \textrm{station}} \|^{2}\rangle_{t}}}{\sqrt{ \langle \| \boldsymbol{u}_{*, \textrm{era}} \| \rangle_{t}\langle \| \boldsymbol{u}_{*, \textrm{station}} \| \rangle_{t}}}
\end{equation}



This $\delta$--parameter is computed for hydrodynamic roughness values ranging from $10^{-5}$~m to $10^{-2}$~m for the different stations. A shown by figure~\ref{Fig3_supp}, the minimum of $\delta$ in the space ($z_{0,\, \textup{Era}}$, $z_{0,\, \textup{in situ}}$) forms a line. We thus take the roughness of the Era5Land dataset as the typical value when sediment transport occurs, $10^{-3}$~m, corresponding to the thickness of the transport layer \citep{Sherman2007}. It leads for the Adamax, Deep Sea, Huab and South Namib stations values of $2.7~\textup{mm}$, $0.76~\textup{mm}$, $0.12~\textup{mm}$ and $0.48~\textup{mm}$, respectively.

The choice of the hydrodynamic roughness values only impacts the calculated shear velocities, but note the wind directions. As such, most of our conclusions are then independent of such a choice, and only the magnitude of the wind velocity attenuation in confined situation might be affected.

\section*{2. Extraction of the ABL properties}

In order to estimate the relevant non-dimensional numbers, one need to estimate in addition to the wind and dune properties some parameters of the ABL. The Era5 dataset provides a direct bulk estimate of the ABL depth $H$ from a bulk Richardson number calculation, as well as vertical profiles of the geopotential $\phi$, temperature $T$ and specific humidity $e_{\textup{w}}$ at given pressure levels $P$. From these quantities, the virtual potential temperature, which takes into account the vertical pressure and humidity changes, can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
  T_{\textup{vp}} = T\left(1 + \left[R_{\textup{M}} - 1\right]e_{\textup{w}}\right)\left(\frac{P_{0}}{P}\right)^{P_{\textup{c}}(1 - 0.24e_{\textup{w}})},
\end{equation}
where $P_{0} = 10^{5}~\textup{Pa}$ is the standard pressure, $P_{\textup{c}} = 0.2854$ the Poisson coefficient for dry air and $R_{\textup{M}}=1.61$ is the ratio between the melocular masses of dry air and water. The vertical coordinates are calculated as:
\begin{equation}
  z = \frac{\phi R_{\textup{t}}}{g R_{\textup{t}} - \phi},
\end{equation}
where $R_{\textup{t}} = 6356766~\textup{m}$ is the average Earth radius, and $g = 9.81~\textup{m}~\textup{s}^{-2}$ the gravitational acceleration.

Example of obtained vertical profiles of the virtual potential temperature are shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig9_supp}. On each of them, an average is computed below the ABL depth given by the Era5 dataset, and a linear function is fitted above.


Under the Boussinesq approximation, the temperature variations are assumed to induce most of those of the density, leading to $\Delta\rho/\rho \simeq \Delta T_{\textup{vp}}/T_{\textup{vp}}$. Here, $T_{\textup{vp}}/T_{\textup{vp}}$ is the relative virtual potential temperature jump at the capping, directly measured on the vertical profiles.

Following \citet{Tritton2012}, the relative density jump at the capping layer

Dots: data from the ERA5 reanalysis. Transparent dashed lines: boundary layer height given by the ERA5 reanalysis, calculated from the bulk Richardson number \citep{seidel2012}. Plain lines: vertical (boundary layer) and linear (free atmosphere) fits to estimate the quantities in Fig.~\ref{Fig10_supp}. \textbf{b}: Examples of ill-processed vertical profiles at 3 different time steps (blue - 2/12/2013 - 2300 UTC, orange - 20/03/2017 - 0000 UTC, green - 14/07/2017 - 1400 UTC) at the South Namib station. \textbf{c}: Hourly distribution of ill-processed vertical profiles. \textbf{d}: Monthly distribution of ill-processed vertical profiles. \cg{These profiles are ill-processed because the temperature found at the boundary layer from the linear fit in the free-atm is smaller than the average one inside the boundary layer. This is an unstable situation, which does not allow to calculate the surface Froude number.}}
